// All three caps are English-tuned (v0.13.12). The Python originals were CJK-tuned
// (1 char ≈ 1 morpheme); English packs ~4–5 chars per word, so the CJK numbers
// rejected most natural English replies and triggered validation retry-storms (the
// "超限率太高" report). These values keep Luna "a spoken presence, not an essay"
// — a few short sentences — while letting natural English through without a fight.

export const MAX_CLAUSE_CHARS = 150; // ~25 words — a long spoken clause, still not a run-on
