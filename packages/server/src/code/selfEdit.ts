// Self-edit proposal builder (Initiative 8, v0.15.4) — PROPOSE-ONLY. It computes
// a unified diff for a requested edit to Luna's own code entirely in memory and
// returns it for a human to review and apply. It NEVER writes the target file (or
// anything else). Two guardrails make this the DGM-safe ceiling:
//   1. The target is gated through resolveInWorkspace(path, 'write') — the SAME
//      firewall every edit/shell write goes through — so the evaluator firewall
//      (tests, lint/ts config, the shell deny-regex, the sandbox itself,
//      humanity.ts, l1Contract.ts, safetyGate.ts) and secrets are hard-rejected.
//      She may propose an edit to her own NON-critical code; never to the code
//      that judges/sandboxes/gates her.
//   2. There is no write path at all — applying a proposal is a separate human
//      action (review the diff, run the normal `edit`, or git apply).
